A Flutter challenge.

## About the project

### What was done

All the minimum requirements were completed. I used MobX for state management, DIO for HTTP requests, and a kind of clean architecture but with shared models between the features.

The APK on the distribution folder contains the code on v1.0.0 tag, although there are other commits after this version.


### Issues

There are some known bugs:
 - When you search there are no pagination;
 - The profile button doesn't do anything (it was supposed to control the favorites and access to the app);
 - The favorite button doesn't do anything;
